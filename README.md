# Sales_Analysis_Project

### Project Overview
Developed an interactive Bike Sales Excel dashboard using advanced features like pivot tables, charts, and slicers to analyse and visualise sales data accurately. By leveraging Excel's functions and formulas, I performed in-depth data analysis, calculated sales percentages, and identified trends for strategic decision-making. I created visually appealing charts, effectively communicating key insights to non-technical stakeholders. With attention to detail, I validated and cross-referenced the data to ensure dashboard reliability.
