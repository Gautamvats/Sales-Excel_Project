# Sales_Excel_Project
<BR>
Developed an interactive Bike Sales Excel dashboard using advanced features like pivot tables, charts, and slicers to analyse and visualise sales data accurately. By leveraging Excel's functions and formulas, I performed in-depth data analysis, calculated sales percentages, and identified trends for strategic decision-making. I created visually appealing charts, effectively communicating key insights to non-technical stakeholders. With attention to detail, I validated and cross-referenced the data to ensure dashboard reliability.
